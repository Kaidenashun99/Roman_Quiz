Welcome!

This is my Practical Python Milestone project written in the Flask Framework.
My project is a quiz that is based on the Roman Empire Era and tests the users
knowledge of the era through a series of ten questions.  

Users can compete against one and other through my score functionality which 
collects the ammount of correct answers a user gets, and posts them into a leaderboard.  
Users have 2 attempts per question and are encouraged to make use of my revision page
to possibly increase their score next time they embark on the quiz.
